                To ensure a level playing field for all participants, the competition
                has a few rules and requirements. Participants are not allowed to use
                Apple M1, M2 and M3 processors, and their clusters must have a minimum of 4
                sockets. MPI is required, and there is a power limit of <Mark>250 watts</Mark> and a
                cost limit of <Mark>$6,000</Mark>.

                title="What is a SBC Cluster?">
                A Single Board Computer (SBC) cluster refers to a group of single-board computers that are interconnected to work together as a unified computing system. 
                Each single-board computer is a complete computer built on a single circuit board, typically with a processor, memory, storage, and various other components.
                When these SBCs are connected in a cluster, they can collectively perform tasks that would be challenging for a single board to handle alone. 
                Clustering allows for parallel processing, where multiple computers work on different parts of a task simultaneously, potentially speeding up computation.
