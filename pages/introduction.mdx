# Introduction

On the 25th of May, the University of California San Diego (UCSD) will be hosting an exciting event focused on high-performance computing. This event is open to all students, researchers, and enthusiasts who are interested in exploring the capabilities of supercomputers and single board computers.

Participants will have the opportunity to showcase their skills in building and optimizing single board computer clusters using the latest hardware and software technologies. The event will feature several benchmarking challenges, including HPL and HPCG, which will be run with MPI. 

The competition focuses on system administration and tuning high-performance computing applications. Relevant experience include scientific computing (like bioinformatics, computational chemistry, etc), parallel computing, system administration and networking. However, no prior experience is required.

The Graph500 applications will also be featured, providing participants with an opportunity to explore the application of high-performance computing in real-world scenarios.

The event will be held both virtually and in-person, with participants having the option to attend in person at UCSD or remotely via online platforms. This will ensure that the event is accessible to as many participants as possible, regardless of their location.

Participants will be required to work within certain constraints, including a power limit of 250 watts and a cost limit of $6,000 MSRP. Teams will also be required to consist of undergraduate and graduate students only.

Overall, this event promises to be an exciting opportunity for anyone interested in high-performance computing to showcase their skills, learn from others, and explore the latest technologies in this rapidly evolving field. We look forward to seeing you there!
